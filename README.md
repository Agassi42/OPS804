# Advanced Data Analysis (OPS804) at Saint Mary's College of California

## Overview

Companies face different challanges in data science and business analytics that go beyond the scope of traditional statistics. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com), for example, tries to identify the customers that have the same purchasing habits and recomends a product that you are most likely to be interested in. In order to solve this question you need to figure out how it is similar and how it is not (cluster analysis). Similarly, the marketing strategy of [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is based on social media and recommendation marketing. So the question for them was: who are the big influencers in the field (social network analysis)?

In this course we will take a look at multiple statistical and data analytical methods and algorithms. We will pick up where where you stoped in the OPS801 (Data Analysis) course starting with regression models and continue our journey by looking at different approaches for different cases. Although some classes depend and build on each other, most of the classes don't, but rather represent a unique approach to analyze different data types and questions. This course combines what you have learned in Data Analysis (OP801), Python (OPS802), and Data Science and Management (OPS803), additionally adding new content in the form of new algorithms and technology.

However, with that said, there is a common underlying band. For all of the assignments, we will use R and RMarkdown to create reproduceable results. 

## Class structure

Every week there will be a new folder in this repository including the data, example code, class notes, in course exercises, and homework descriptions for the week's class. You have to ensure that you sync your local repository regulary to gain the required information. Every meeting will incorporate a lecture setting explaining the concepts of the topic and a hands-on component, where you will work on the discussed topic in class with your programming partner.

## ToDo List before class

In order to follow this class you need to make sure that you understand the concept of programming, database logic, statistics, and algebra. There will be no time in class to work on installations, computer specific problems, or missig understanding from the previous classes. The following steps need to be done before class starts:
